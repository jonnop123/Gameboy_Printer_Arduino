Gameboy_Printer_Arduino
=======================

Here is some code and a sample program I made to interface a Gameboy Printer with an Arduino.

I have included:

- An Arduino sketch that can print letters
- some photos
- A word document with some info of my understanding of how tiles are coded
- gbtd, a program used for creating 8x8 tiles and saving them in hex format (directly printable)
- A program created in Visual Studio 2012 that can send text to a specified COM port using serial.

Details of how to connect them up can be found at the first link in the word document.

Enjoy! :)
